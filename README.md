Organize music folder and retrieve album art
I wrote this to organize my Music folder which suffers from me just indiscriminatly dumping music files into it.
It reads the metadata from the file and creates an artist folder if one doesn't exist and places the file in it.
It then looks in the artist folders and creates album folders for the tracks and puts the tracks in the folder.
It also checks if the file already exists and discards the new one if it's a duplicate.
